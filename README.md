ðŸš€ The Beginning of Something Bigger: My First Frontend Project! ðŸš€
I'm excited to share the first iteration of my new project: a landing page for a job portal called DIT-CareerConnect. This project is a major learning milestone for me, and I'll be adding more features to it over time.

For this initial version, I focused on creating a clean, professional user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The most rewarding part was implementing the small details, like the scrolling announcement banner, to make the page feel more dynamic.

I'm just getting started and have big plans to expand this project's functionality in the future. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this first version as I continue to build it out!

HTML5
